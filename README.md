# Y.A.MAKER

## Project 3 
  For our final project we were required to use the skill set we have developed throughout the course. We have designed a full stack website using ReactJS with a MySQL database. The new technologies we have implemented into our project are paypal and cloudinary. The owner of the website will have a login to maintain the gallery page using a modal.  

# The Handcrafted Heirloom

  "The Handcrafted Heirloom" is a custom made website for a local woodworking business in Arizona. This website will serve as a storefront that allows customers to view and purchase handmade wood crafted goods. Customers are also able to request a personalized commissioned piece. This website will allow for the expansion of the clients customer base beyond his local area, as well as promote his business on a global scale.
